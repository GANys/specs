[big]*iii.   Preface*


Note that this document requires a good knowledge of the OGC City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) Encoding Standard (https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=47842[OGC document #12-019]), it reuses its terminology and follow the data model presented in it.

The differences between the CityJSON v1.0 implementation and the XML-based implementation are described https://www.cityjson.org/citygml-compatibility[in this webpage].

[big]*i.     Abstract*

CityJSON is a https://json.org/[JSON]-based encoding for a subset of the http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/citygml[OGC CityGML data model] (version 2.0.0). It defines how to store digital 3D models of cities and landscapes. The aim of CityJSON is to offer an alternative to the GML encoding of CityGML, which can be verbose and complex to read and manipulate. CityJSON aims at being easy-to-use, both for reading datasets and for creating them. It was designed with programmers in mind, so that tools and APIs supporting it can be quickly built.
